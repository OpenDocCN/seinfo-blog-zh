## **规避每个人的防御机制。T3】**

Have no Illusions, no matter what environment you're located In at the time, be It your workplace or simply relaxing on the couch at home, I can get you to perform a given action without you even realizing what you've done.

***'Human Firewall' Defined:***

Not only do devices such as computers, web servers and networks have firewalls to keep the bad guys out, you may not realize It, but you too have what's called the **"Human Firewall"** on a personal level. 
  For Instance, If someone tries to social engineer you over the phone, with the Intention to have you read out your password, your "Human Firewall" kicks In and you make the decision to keep It to yourself. This Is the main purpose of social engineering- exploiting the human firewall, by manipulating the person to do things he's not supposed to do to begin with.
  From an SE'rs standpoint, by no means Is this limited to obtaining personal details from the target. It can Include things like getting a company representative to Issue a refund or replacement for an Item that the social engineer does not actually own, or from a physical perspective, gaining access to a live concert by assuming the role of a security guard, showing a fake ID and simply walking Into the building. The possibilities are endless.
