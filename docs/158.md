## **色尔从用户那里拿钱，意外存在。T3】**

In the world of exploiting the human firewall and circumventing the terms and conditions of companies on every scale, It's paramount for social engineers to keep up-to-date with changes as they come to hand by developing the very latest methods. Of equal Importance, Is to ensure that a given method used In bypassing company protocol, ***does not become saturated, hence render It useless***.
  As such, **"SE'rs make their methods private"**, and only distribute a limited amount to reputable users. By doing this, the method will not become widespread and abused by every social engineer who can get his hands on It. This Is how It generally works In an honest and Ideal social engineering environment, however not all SE'ers have this Intention In mind. 
  Sadly, there are many **"social engineering scammers"**, who prey on fellow SE'ers by promising one thing, but deliver either nothing In return, or something completely different to what they originally agreed on and make an **"exit scam"** thereafter. So what exactly Is an **"exit scam?"**. Let's check It out now.
  **Exit Scam Defined And Performed:**
  ***An "exit scam", Is simply disappearing after receiving payment for a particular Item***.There are many ways that an exit scam can be performed, but for the purpose of this article, I'll be referring to ***selling a social engineering method via an Internet forum***- also known as a message board. Almost every board has a **"Market Place"** section, whereby members can sell and buy Items with other registered users. What a **"social engineer scammer"** does, Is ***advertise a "seemingly" rare and sought-after private SEing method*** In the Sales section of the forum.
  He'll first befriend as many members as possible, and engage In friendly conversation- ***just to gain their trust and not raise suspicion***. Once he's built a profile within the community that appears honest and reliable, he'll create a thread In the Sales section advertising the so-called social engineering method. The cost of the method Is usually quite cheap, thus will attract buyers rather quickly.
  Given the scammer has already established a reputation with other users to some degree, he'll **"ask for payment upfront"**, and promise to Immediately send off the method to all buyers the moment the funds clear Into his account. ***Of course, he'll do no such thing!*** When he's received the money from ex-amount of members, he will then **"make his exit scam"**, by cutting off all communications with the community, and never return again.
  ***The social engineer scammer usually repeats the above process, by registering on other Internet forums*** and using a completely different and unrelated username. The unfortunate thing Is, there's nothing that the board's administrators can do to recover lost funds, but there Is a lot **"you can do to protect yourself from falling victim"**. This brings me to my next point.
  **How To Protect Against An Exit Scam:**
  The first thing you need to realize, Is **"never trust anyone In the online community"**, Irrespective of how well they present themselves and the number of years you've been related as cyber friends. Adopting this type of attitude, automatically triggers your defense mechanism, thereby significantly helps to keep you alert at all times. With regards to performing transactions on Internet forums, **"never pay for an Item upfront"**. Use either a **trusted "MM"** (Middleman), or an online service such as [Escrow](https://www.escrow.com/).
  Also, **"read what other users have said about the seller"** and where possible, checkout other message boards to see whether the same seller Is operating, and what capacity his sales are actively running. Lastly, If **"something seems too good to be true, It probably Is"**. You will never be 100% protected from social engineering scammers, but you'll certainly come close If you apply the above preventative measures accordingly.
