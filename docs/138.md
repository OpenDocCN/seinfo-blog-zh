## **社会工程的定义及其使用方法。T3】**

When you navigate on the net and hit a Google search with the terms **"social engineering definition"**, there are countless pages returned, some of which are plagiarized, and others provide Its meaning In their very own wording. Or do they In fact define It In Its entirety? For the most part, no! Check It out for yourself, and you'll find that the majority of online sources say something (not verbatim) along the lines of: **"A technique to grab confidential Information, and/or Infect a computer with malware to gain unauthorized access"**. Whilst this Is certainly true, It barely covers the basics of what social engineering entails as a whole.
  I've been SEing for over 30 years and to this day, I'm at a loss as to how major security firms fail to understand precisely what's Involved In the art of human hacking. For Instance, [Webroot](https://www.webroot.com/au/en/resources/tips-articles/what-is-social-engineering) who's been around since the late 90s, says: **"Social engineering Is the art of manipulating people so they give up confidential Information"**. Really? Is that all there Is to It? Moreover, [Kaspersky](https://www.kaspersky.com.au/resource-center/definitions/what-is-social-engineering) explains It In a similar fashion, with the addition of: **"To lure unsuspecting users Into exposing data, spreading malware Infections, or giving access to restricted systems"**. Do they honestly believe that social engineering Is solely relative to this alone? Enough said. Allow me to explain It to you In the next topic.
  **The 'True Meaning' Of Social Engineering:**
  It's all the above pertaining to online sources failing to get It right, Inclusive of  Webroot and Kaspersky, that's prompted me to write this article on **"The true meaning of social engineering"**, namely to give you a very good understanding on exactly what It Involves and how It's used. My definition Is: ***"Social engineering Is manipulating the person or entity on the other end Into doing something they're not supposed to do"***. When you think about It, It's really as simple as that.
  Whether It be obtaining confidential Information by deceiving the store manager Into giving up an employee's date of birth, refunding a cell phone from Amazon by manipulating the representative and claiming that you didn't receive It, or simply pretending to be a cleaner by getting an employee to hold the security entry door open for you, thereby gaining unauthorized access to a restricted building- ***they're all relative to one thing, "social engineering". That Is, "manipulating" the person on the other end to achieve your objective***.
  The **"result"** of your social engineering attack, Is of no relevance. ***It's the "method" that's used to achieve the result, that's classed as social engineering**.* And the **"method"** Is the **"manipulation"**. It doesn't matter **"what your goal Is"**, but what does matter Is **"how you achieve It"**. And It's this that gives social engineering Its name! To give you a general Idea on the ***"manipulation" side of SEing to ultimately get what you're after***, I'll demonstrate a couple of social engineering examples In point form.
  **Example One- Obtaining A Free Cell Phone:**
  In this example, we'll be social engineering a cell phone from an online company, by manipulating the representative to Issue a full refund. ***It doesn't matter whether the company Is on a large scale with 10,000 employees, or a family business of 5 staff members- they're all vulnerable to human exploitation***. Here's how It works.

*   你已经联系了公司，说你已经收到包裹，但是设备有缺陷。显然不是，但这是你用来对他们进行社会改造的借口。
*   经过几个故障诊断步骤后，您告诉他们电话仍然无法正常工作，销售代表要求您将其退回以获得全额退款。
*   你没有寄出手机，而是在盒子里放了与物品重量相符的干冰。这给人一种感觉，好像电话是装在盒子里的。
*   你还在包装底部做了一个轻微的撕开，刚好够手机大小，用不同颜色的胶带封住。T3】
*   然后包裹被寄出，当他们收到包裹时，干冰已经升华，包裹上的裂缝与运输途中被盗的手机相符。
*   因此，他们与运营商进行了交叉检查，经过一些调查后，确信手机被盗。此后，你将获得全额退款。
*   你现在有了一部全新的手机和退款，这意味着你没有为这部手机 支付一分钱。

看 ***【方法】*** 是如何被用来达到成功的结局的？它篡改了包装，因此 ***操纵另一端的人做了他们不应该做的事情***——那就是为手机提供全额退款。你现在有设备加上你的钱回来，最终导致一个免费的手机！让我们看看下面的另一个例子。

**例子二——获得对受限建筑的非授权访问:**

*   You spent a whole week researching this company, sitting in the car, paying attention to the clothes of employees and how they entered the building through the main entrance.
*   You have noticed that there is a password here to enter the system. The only way is to enter the password on the keyboard. Obviously you don't have a password.
*   During the whole week's observation, you found that every employee started work at 9:00 am on time. At about 8: 05 a.m. on Monday, you have to pretend to be a member of the company staff to perform your SE duties.
*   Considering that you know the clothes of office staff, you should put on your suit and tie accordingly, pick up your briefcase and drive to the office.

*   You decide to join this group and pretend to be discussing a specific business report with someone on your mobile phone. When an employee enters the password on the keyboard of the entrance door, you politely ask him if he can open the door for you. Because of your pleasant manners and the fact that your clothes conform to the nature of employees, employees are happy to help. Now you can enter this building and have many opportunities to do what you want.

As with the first example above, you can clearly see how your ***"method"  ***(by dressing appropriately) was used to manipulate the employee (by having your hands full) ***to do something that he was not supposed to do***. And that was to allow you access to a restricted building.

**In Conclusion:**

So now you're fully aware, that social engineering Is all about the "**method used"**to manipulate a given person/entity Into performing an action that they're not supposed to do- ***no matter what the end result may be***. In both of the above examples, the **"Intention of the SE"**, Is completely different- one Is to obtain a free cell phone and the other Is to gain unauthorized access to the building. Each objective, regardless of Its difference, succeeded due to the **"method used"**. Of course, In the last example, **"research"** also played a significant role to formulate the method effectively.
