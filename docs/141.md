*Updated: 08/09/2022: *

**If you've ever wanted to know every term and method relative to social engineering, Irrespective of your level of experience, then you've come to the right place. This SEing encyclopedia, has everything you need pertaining to common terms and methods that're used In today's world of exploiting the human firewall. All topics Include a brief description, as well as a few examples of how each term Is used In a sentence- which will be of benefit to those new to the SEing sector. To help refine your search, I've added a table of contents, whereby you can pick and choose exactly what you're looking for. **

## **每个社会工程术语的定义。**

When you look up the definition of **"social engineering"** In Its proper context, for the most part, It's defined as ***grabbing sensitive Information from unsuspecting people, or Infecting their computer with malware and the like to achieve the very same result.*** And one major security firm named [Kaspersky](https://usa.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/social-engineering), has this documented on their very own [official website](https://usa.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/social-engineering). Have a read and see for yourself. Whilst no doubt this Is true and correct, by no means does It come close to what ***SEing Involves, and the types of methods used to formulate and execute the attack.*** It's quite poor that a security organization on the scale of Kaspersky, has minimal knowledge on the art of exploiting the human firewall- which can be of little benefit to those **"who're new to social engineering"**, and want to learn every facet, term and abbreviation of what It entails.
  As such, If they've joined an SEing community on an Internet forum or registered on a chat server such as Discord, thereby partake In discussions with users who've been In the scene for many years, **"the beginner SE'er will be at a complete loss as to the terms used, and what they actually mean"**. Even a Google search, will predominantly fail to return results. If you're new and as you're reading this article, you'd also be confused- as I've already used a number of words In their shortened form.
  ***It's very much a commonality for social engineers to "abbreviate their wording"*** and only those who are SE'ers themselves, will know exactly what they denote. Although It doesn't take too long to pickup terms here and there, It can become somewhat frustrating- particularly when there's no online resource to refer to, nor any member around who's willing to give you a hand. Reset assured, I've got you covered! In this article, ***I will cover every possible social engineering term that I can think of, and will also provide a short sentence (for each one) on how It's commonly used.*** This way, you'll know precisely what Its abbreviation (and long form) means, and how It's used In a sentence/post.
  I will not only define abbreviations, but also **"terms and methods In full"**, that are very often used when selecting and preparing methods. This too, will give you a clear understanding of what they mean In social engineering parlance. What you're about to read Is "**VERY** **VERY DETAILED"**, yet straight to the point, so strap yourself In and enjoy the ride.

**Table Of Contents:**
  To help minimize your search, refer to the contents below. Each one Is listed In chronological order so If you're on the Windows platform, ***hit "Ctrl+F" on your keyboard, and enter the term/topic you're after.*** Evidently, It will jump straight to the search In question.

**What Is 'SEing?'**
  This Is one of the most commonly used terms In the world of social engineering, which means exactly this- **"Social Engineering"**. You will find that every Internet forum and chat gateway where social engineering Is discussed, will utilize "**SEing" **quite often. It's sometimes used with an apostrophe as **"SE'ing"**.

Examples
  * How long have you been SEing for?
* He was only a beginner at SEing.
* I love SEing, It's a lot of fun.
  **The Definition Of 'SEd'**
  As with the above, this Is also used with an apostrophe as **"SE'd"**, but obviously they both denote the same thing which Is **"Social Engineered"**. Those who've been In the SEing scene for a long time, will always use **"SEd"**. I for one, cannot remember the last time I used ***social engineered *** anywhere online.
  Examples
  * I SEd Amazon over 20 times on the same account.
* Someone called and I think he SEd my password.
* There's no way he SEd that Item using the Partial method.
  **'SEs' Defined**
  To the contrary of both the above, **"SEs"** Is not too often used In social engineering communities, but nonetheless, It's certainly worthy of familiarizing yourself with Its meaning which Is **"Social Engineerings"**. This Is always used as the abbreviation- due to Its long form not making much sense at all.
  Examples
  * Too many SEs will lock your account.
* What methods did you use for those SEs?
* All of my SEs were successful last week.
  **The Meaning Of 'SE'er'**
  Used to describe the person who social engineers, hence **"SE'er"** short for **"Social Engineerer".** It's abbreviated and used as such, mainly because ***social engineerer*** Is not In the English vocabulary and (as with **"SEs"** above) when used as a whole word, It doesn't make any sense. This Is predominantly used with an apostrophe and seldom without.
  Examples
  * John Is the best SE'er I've come across.
* That SE'er Is really good at refunding.
* The SE'er tried grabbing my data but failed.
  **What Does 'SE' Mean?**
  Without question, this Is the most frequently used term In the art of human hacking. Even If you've just started reading guides etc, you would've definitely experienced the abbreviation of **"SE"** which Is **"Social Engineering"** and depending on the context of the sentence, **"Social Engineer"**. This can be used In many ways, but obviously I cannot demonstrate the lot.
  Examples
  * Preparing the SE effectively Is crucial.
* Did you SE the AirPods as yet?
* I'm planning to SE Susan tomorrow.
  **Definition Of Se'able**
  This Is one term that you won't come across often no matter where you're conversation Is taking place, but nevertheless, It's still Important to understand Its abbreviation. "**Se'able" Is **short for **"Social Engineerable"**, which as you can see, the latter Is not a part of the English vocabulary, so It's always used as **"se'able"**. It just means that an given entity scan be social engineered.
  Examples
  *  Hey, do you know If Argos Is still se'able?
* SSDs are se'able using the partial method.
 * Peter was se'able so I grabbed his password. 
  **The 'DNA' Defined**
  This Is equally used In Its abbreviated and long form. Put simply, **"DNA"** stands for **"Did Not Arrive"** which (as Its name Implies), the social engineer claims that the Item/package he ordered from an online retailer, did not arrive at his premises. I personally like using **"DNA"**- It's quicker and easy to relate to, but that's just me.
  Examples
  * I'm going to DNA the keyboard tomorrow.
* The DNA method can be used for any Item.
* Because of the DNA, they opened an Investigation.
  **What Is DNA'd?**
  As with the above, namely **DNA**, this has the very same meaning, but used In past tense rather than In Its present form. If you haven't worked It out already, **"DNA'd"** Is **"Did Not Arrived"**. Clearly, you can see why It's abbreviated- **"Did Not Arrived"** Is not grammatically correct, thus It will never be used as such In the social engineering community.
  Examples
  * I DNA'd the package and receiving a refund.
* How many Items have you DNA'd on your account?
 * The refunder DNA'd the IPhone for me.
  **The Definition Of 'Wrong Item Received'**
  A very effective method used by social engineers when SEing a company to obtain a refund or replacement, Is the **"Wrong Item Received"** method. In short, the SE'er will claim that the company sent an Incorrect Item and when asked to return It, they'll process a refund/replacement. There Is no abbreviation for this- It's always used as written: **"wrong Item received".**
  Examples
  * What Item should I use as the wrong Item received?
* The weight must match with the wrong Item received method.
* Use a stock Item as the wrong Item received.
  **The 'Missing Item' Method**
  As with the above method, this Is always used In Its long form being: "**missing Item"** method and never abbreviated. As Its name suggests, social engineers use It when claiming that the Item they've ordered from an online company, was missing when the package was delivered and opened. This method Is very common In the SEing scene.
  Examples
  * That's too heavy for the missing Item method.
* I might use the missing Item method for a CPU.
* Should I use the missing Item method or DNA?
  **The 'Boxing' Method**
  No matter where you navigate In the social engineering sector, you will come across the **"boxing"** method, which Is mainly written as **"Box"** It Involves sending a box back to the company without the Item, and tearing the package as though the Item was stolen before It reached them. The SE'er then gets a refund or replacement.
  Examples
  * Just box them using dry Ice.
* The Item Is light so use the boxing method.
* How many times can I box that company?
    **The 'Double Dip' Method**
  This Is not used too often at all, namely due to the complexity of what the SE Involves by using the **"double dip"** method. Without going Into too much detail, It's simply social engineering the same company twice In row- with the Intention of getting two Items free of charge. The term Is used as **"double dipping"** and sometimes **"double dip"**.
  Examples
  * I've double dipped Amazon heaps of times.
* It's too dangerous to double dip that Item.
* I'm not sure If I should double dip or just refund.
  **The 'Triple Drip' Method**
  This works In a similar fashion as the double dip method, except Instead of social engineering the same company twice, ***It's done three times***  thereby receiving 3 Items absolutely free. Whenever you read about this method, It will be written as **"triple dipping"** or **"triple dip"**. Sometimes It's also used as **"triple dipped"**.
  Examples
  * You're mad to triple dip Logitech.
* I think the rep knew he was triple dipped.
* Only experienced SE'ers should be triple dipping.
  **A 'Drop House'**
  The **"Drop House"**, Is a house that does not belong to the social engineer and Is used as a delivery point to receive packages. There are many reasons to use this, with the most common being to protect the SE'rs Identity, and/or to avoid being billed by the company who's sending the goods. This Is also used as **"Drop Address"** or simply **"Drop"**.
  Examples
  * What's the best way to locate a drop house?
* They will bill you so make sure to use a drop.
* The drop address has a for sale sign on It.
  **The Definition Of 'POP'**
  When a social engineer SEs an Item and requests for a refund or replacement, before the company Issues It, they may ask for a **"POP"** which Is short for **"Proof Of Purchase"**, just to verify that the Item was purchased from their store. I'd say both Its abbreviation and long form are equally used, but I personally prefer **"POP"**.
  Examples
  * Can anyone Photoshop a fake POP?
* Do they check the order number on the POP?
* Don't worry about the POP, say you got It as a gift.
  **What Does 'AR' Stand For?**
  If you've never come across "**AR"**, you'd be at a complete loss as to what It's referring to. It's an abbreviation of "Advanced Replacement".  Not too many companies offer this as part of their claims process, but for those that do, It means that they will send the Item BEFORE the defective product Is returned to them, hence **"Advanced Replacement"**.
  Examples
  * They've confirmed that an AR will be sent.
* Do you know If HP bills with Advanced Replacements?
* To be safe, use a drop house with the AR.
  **'POD' Defined**
  **"POD"** which Is short for **"Proof Of Destruction"**, Is not too commonly used. When SEing a company, prior to them sending a replacement for a defective Item, the representative will ask the SE'er to destroy the defective Item/device by (for example) breaking the buttons and cutting the cord on the computer mouse, or drilling holes In the Hard Disk Drive, thus **"Proof Of Destruction"**.
  Examples
  * It's common for Logitech to ask for a POD.
* I found an Image on Google for the proof of destruction.
* To avoid the POD, just say you threw out the Item.
  **What Is An 'RMA?'**
  Short for **"Return Merchandise Authorization"**, an **"RMA"** Is Issued by a company to approve a refund or replacement of an Item. It's very rare that social engineers will refer to this by It's extended name, but rather abbreviate Its usage as **"RMA"**. Nonetheless, be sure to familiarize yourself with each term.
  Examples
  * I got the email with the RMA number.
* Can you explain a Return Merchandise Authorization to me?
* I will SE the representative to avoid an RMA.
  **The Meaning Of 'C&D'**
  Now this Is one term that you'll rarely come across, when communicating on forums or Discord. **"C&D"** stands for **"Cease And Desist"**, which Is a letter Issued by a company to the SE'er asking him to stop his SEing activity. The company Is obviously aware of the SE'ers actions and If he doesn't stop, they'll start legal proceedings.
  Examples
  * Why did I get the Cease and Desist letter?
* Don't worry about the C&D, they won't do anything.
* SEing a 40$ Item won't be worth them sending a C&D.
  **The Abbreviation Of 'SN'**
  This Is very much common knowledge for advanced SE'ers, but when It's used and written as **"SN"**, It makes very little to no sense to novice social engineers. Going by personal experience, I'd say that It's equally used as **"SN"** and **"Serial Number"**. It's also used simply as **"Serial"**, but not as often as the others.
  Examples
  * I'm after a serial number to SE SteelSeries.
* I'll give you a serial If you give me some rep.
* Get the SN from someone on eBay.
  **'Tracking Number'**
  When a product has been purchased and shipped to the delivery address, a **"Tracking Number"** Is assigned to the package. It's usually sent In a confirmation email after the Item has been ordered. It allows the customer to track and see the location of their package at any point In time, by entering It Into the website's tracking option of It's respective carrier. This Is never abbreviated.
  Examples
  * Just show the tracking number to PayPal.
* Scanning the barcode displays the tracking number.
* The tracking number has the sender & receiver details.
  **'Corrupted File'**
  The **"Corrupted File"** Is a method used by SE'ers, when companies ask them to provide a picture or video that must Include the Item and other Identifiable details. Once they receive It, a refund Is Issued. However ***SE'ers don't have the Item to begin with***, so they send a **"Corrupted File"**, and assure the company that It's working fine on their end. The SE'er will keep repeating the process until the company finally gives up and provides a refund.
  Examples
  * Use this website for the corrupted file method.
* Be sure to send the corrupted file In different formats.
* The rep checked the corrupted file and couldn't open It.
  **Definition Of 'Reship'**
  Some SE'ers use what's called a **"Reship"** (or **"Reshipping"**) company rather than their own address. Once the package has been sent by the online store, It's delivered to the reship company's warehouse and they'll forward It to the SE'ers house. This Is a good way to keep your real address hidden from the online store.
  Examples
  * That reshipping company Is fine for the UK.
* Hey, It's good to use a drop address & a reship.
* Can Logitech see that I'm using a reship?
  **'Receipt Generator'**
  Many social engineers go to great lengths to succeed with whom they're SEing and If It means falsifying paperwork to achieve their objective, they will do just that to the company who's requesting It. Such paperwork, Is to create a fake receipt using a **"Receipt Generator"**. This term Is always used as written.
  Examples
  * The Amazon receipt generator Is awesome.
* Anyone have a Best Buy receipt generator?
* That online receipt generator doesn't work anymore.
  **'Investigation'**
  Every online supplier, differs to some degree In the way they address and process refund and replacement claims, but a very common approach with the majority of retailers, Is to open what's called an **"Investigation"**. This Is used to check whether there's any Inconsistencies with what the social engineer has provided to the company.
  Examples
  * An Investigation Is simply part of company protocol.
* The DNA has led to an Investigation being opened.
* After the Investigation, I received the refund.
  **'Police Report'**
  Further to the above pertaining to a company opening an Investigation, the company could also ask the SE'er to obtain a **"Police Report"** to help with their Inquiry. Amongst other reasons, the police report Is often requested when the SE'er uses the DNA (Did Not Arrive) or the missing Item method.
  Examples
  * You can get a police report online.
* A police report Is not legally binding.
* What If SteelSeries asks for a police report?
  **The 'Blood Method'**
  Social engineers use a very clever method to avoid sending an Item back to the company, namely the **"blood method"**. Health & safety Is taken very seriously by companies on every scale, hence the majority refuse to accept goods that contains blood. When formulated correctly, this Is very effective Indeed.
  Examples.
  * I'll use the blood method when I call Argos tomorrow.
* Read their terms to see If the blood method will work.
* The blood method Is great when SEing perfume with broken glass.
  **'Cross Shipping'**
  There are many options used by companies when dispatching customer orders and receiving warranty claims, and one of these options Is called **"Cross Shipping"**. There are a few steps Involved but for the simplicity of this article, It's when a company ships a package containing the replacement Item at the same time the customer (SE'er) sends their package containing the defective Item.
  Examples
  * I'm going to box Amazon with the cross shipping.
* I don't think they do cross shipping anymore.
* Can any Item be used with cross shipping?
  **What Does 'VCC' Mean?**
  A **"VCC"** Is an abbreviation of **"Virtual Credit Card"**. Unlike your physical (plastic) credit card, It's simply a number that's associated with your real card. Think of It as a disposable card- If anything happens to It, just get a new one. Generally, It can only be used once and cannot be traced to the real card. SE'ers use this to anonymize their real credit card when SEing a company.
  Examples
  * Use a VCC with the advanced replacement.
* Do you know of a trusted VCC provider?
* Get another VCC number when SEing HP.
  **The 'Faulty Item Disposed' Method**
  When SEing an Item that has (seemingly) lost functionality, the representative will go through a few troubleshooting steps and then ask the SE'er to return the Item for a refund or replacement. Rather than returning It, the social engineer will use the **"Faulty Item Disposed"** method, by saying that he threw It out due to health & safety concerns.
  Examples
  * The faulty Item disposed method suits electrical goods.
* I got a refund using the faulty Item disposed method.
* The rep knew I was using the faulty Item disposed method.
  **The 'Gift Method'**
  When SEing a company for a particular Item that you don't have to begin with, before they can approve the claim, they'll sometimes ask for the POP (Proof Of Purchase). Obviously you don't have It, so to circumvent the rep's request, you'd use the **"Gift Method"** by saying you've received the Item as a gift from a friend.
  Examples
  * You don't need a POP, use the gift method.
* Any tips on what I should say with the gift method?
* Stick with the gift method for the AirPods.
  **'Similar Item' Method**
  Manufacturers/suppliers can make errors when picking and packing products prior to dispatch- particularly when two or more Items are very similar In appearance. Social engineers are well aware of this, and use the **"Similar Item Method"**, by sending back an old Item that looks very similar to the original. As such, the rep will assume It's the ordered Item and process a refund.
  Examples
  * I'm sending my old CPU using the similar Item method.
* They won't check with the similar Item method.
* How many times can I use the similar Item method?
  **'Human Hacking'**
  I'm sure you know by now that social engineering Is a form of hacking, but as opposed to traditional hackers using technical means to compromise a particular website or computer, SEing Is achieved by manipulating the person In question. As a result, It's the human that's exploited, and not the device. So the terms **"Human Hacking"** and "Social Engineering" are Interchangeable.
  Examples
  * That book on human hacking Is brilliant!
* I've bee human hacking for over 10 years.
* Everyone Is vulnerable to human hacking.
  **'Human Firewall'**
  Not only do devices such as computers and networks have firewalls to keep the bad guys out, you may not realize It, but you too have what's called the **"Human Firewall"** on a personal level. For Instance, If someone tries to SE you over the phone, with the Intention to have you read out your password, your **"Human Firewall"** kicks In and you make the decision to keep It to yourself.
  Examples
  * I can exploit anyone's human firewall.
* Train your staff's human firewall regularly.
* His human firewall didn't stop my SE.
  **'Image Metadata'**
  When a company asks for a POP (Proof Of Purchase) from the social engineer and he doesn't have It, he'll Photoshop It and send It In the form of an Image file. However, the rep can see It's been edited, by viewing the **"Image Metadata"**. The SE'er Is always one step ahead- he'll simply change the **"Image Metadata"** accordingly.
  Examples
  * Be sure to edit the Image metadata beforehand.
* I found a great site to change Image metadata.
* What should I enter In the Image metadata?
  **The 'MM' Service**
  The **"MM"** service Is an abbreviation of **"Middle Man"** service, and Is often used In forums/boards for purchases made within the confines of the same community. The **"MM"** Is a trusted user who acts for the buyer and the seller, by holding the funds and ensuring the buyer gets the product, and the seller gets his money.
  Examples
  * Ask the administrator to be a MM.
* Do you know If Jodi98 Is a trusted MM?
* Play It safe and get an MM for the exchange.
  **'FTID' Method**
  At the time of this article, this Is a relatively new method that contains a lot of flaws and Inconsistencies. **"FTID"** Is short for **"Fake Tracking ID"**, but Is almost always used as "FTID". In very brief terms, you send an envelope with the tracking number, and make It look like It's an ad. The company will receive It and throw It out (because It's an ad) and Issue a refund.
  Examples
  * Won't they check the weight with the FTID?
* Can someone tell me how the FTID works?
* What details do I remove with the FTID method?
  **The 'EB' Method**
  Although this Is not so much of commonality In social engineering parlance, It's still worth taking note of Its meaning and usage. **"EB"** Is an abbreviation of **"Empty Box"**, which Is no different to the "missing Item method" already mentioned mid-way through this guide. 
  Examples
  * 50 grams Is fine for the EB method.
* Is an Investigation opened when using the EB method?
* I used the EB method successfully for the SSD.

**The 'Sealed Box Method'**
  This Is always used as written, namely **"Sealed Box Method"** without any abbreviation. The method Itself, Is not used as often as (for example) the DNA, but very effective when formulated correctly. The objective Is to replace the SEd Item (with an old Item you have lying around the house), In the box without showing any signs of tampering whatsoever. As a result, the company will think that you've sent the original one back, and Issue a refund.
  Examples
  * Any Item can be used with the sealed box method.
* Make sure the weight matches with the sealed box method.
* Use the sealed box method with Amazon, they don't check.
  **A 'Statutory Declaration'**
  A** "Statutory Declaration"**,Is a written statement that declares that everything stated Is true and correct. It Is signed In the presence of an authorized witness such as a police officer or medical practitioner (doctor). A company may request the SE'er to sign one as part of their Investigation process. This Is also abbreviated as **"Stat Dec"**.
  Examples
  * Sign the statutory declaration, It's not legally binding.
* I'm confused about what to do with the stat dec.
* Don't fake a statutory declaration!

**An 'Affidavit'**
  Unlike a ***Statutory Declaration ***that must be signed In front of a Justice of the Peace to make It legally binding, an affidavit Is quite the opposite. Put simply, ***once an affidavit Is signed, It becomes a legally binding document and can be used as evidence In court***. In terms of SEing, It's used for the purpose of confirming that the Information you've provided about the actions of your SE, Is In fact true and correct.
  Examples
  * I recommend to not sign the affidavit.
* I think this Is an affidavit, can anyone confirm?
* What's the difference between an affidavit and a stat dec? 
  **'PayPal Dispute'**
  Not everything goes according to plan with every SE and when a company refuses to refund an Item, the SE'er will open a **"PayPal Dispute"**, whereby the buyer & seller will try and come to an agreement. If they can't (which will obviously be the case with the social engineer), then It will be escalated to a claim. 
  Examples
  * Contact PayPal's Resolution Center for the dispute.
* The dispute Is the first thing to do with PayPal.
* Hey, don't agree with seller In the dispute.
  **'PayPal Claim'**
  After the social engineer has opened a PayPal Dispute and failed to reach an agreement with the seller, It then gets escalated to a **"PayPal Claim"**. This Is when PayPal steps In by reviewing the case, and ultimately decide the outcome In an Impartial and unbiased manner. PayPal Claims have a 20 day time frame from when the Dispute was deemed Inconclusive.
  Examples
  * Why Is PayPal taking so long with the Claim?
* Login to your PayPal account and click escalate to a Claim.
* PayPal approved the Claim and I'm getting a refund.
  **Perform A 'Chargeback'**
  If the PayPal Claim Is declined by PayPal, the SE'er can still get a refund from his credit card provider by performing what's called a **"Chargeback"**. If successful, the credit card provider will get the funds from PayPal's merchant, who will then get the funds from PayPal Itself, and PayPal will grab the cash from the seller. 
  Examples
  * A Chargeback should only be used as a backup plan.
* PayPal must agree to pay when a Chargeback succeeds.
* Don't do too many Chargebacks on the same account.
  **'Section 75' Claim**
  As with PayPal claims/disputes and credit card chargebacks, a **"Section 75"** claim works In a similar fashion, but the difference Is that you file a claim against your credit card provider for a refund. However, the Item or service that you're claiming to refund, must be valued over £100 and not over £30,000\. A Section 75 only covers Individuals and not businesses.
  Examples
  * What are my chances with a Section 75?
* Your credit card provider must reply to your Section 75.
 * If the Section 75 fails, contact the ombudsman.
  **The 'Partial Method'**
  The **"Partial Method"**, Is based on the same principle as both the 'missing Item method' and the 'empty box method'. However, rather than SEing an Item on Its own, the SE'er will order a bunch of Items shipped together, and then claim that one was missing. It must be extremely light that will not register a weight on consignment, hence the company cannot cross-check the details with the carrier. This method Is also only written as **"Partial"**.
  Examples
  * What's the maximum weight with the partial method?
* I'm doing a partial, so I'll let you know how It goes.
* That's too heavy to do a partial, use another Item.
  **A 'Bank Reversal'**
  When doing a **"Bank Reversal"**, It's no different to a Chargeback via the credit card provider. The process Is the same, with the only difference being that It's done with your bank Instead of the credit card sector. If the bank deems the claim In favor of the SE'er, then PayPal has no say In the matter, and must Issue a refund.
  Examples
  * I think the bank reversal Is going well.
* Don't be greedy with too many bank reversals.
* It's not worth doing a bank reversal for that cheap Item.
  **What Is An 'AWB?'**
  An **"AWB"** which Is an abbreviation of **"Air Waybill"**, Is rarely spoken of In the SEing community, but nonetheless, It must be familiarized by all SE'ers. It's simply a receipt Issued by an International carrier that's used for air freight, to confirm the shipment of goods from the sender to the recipient. It's similar to how a ***tracking number***  operates, but Instead, the AWB Is used for International shipments.
  Examples
  * Does the AWB barcode get scanned?
* Just put fake details on the AWB
* An AWB Is a proof of receipt for the goods
  **PayPal 'SNAD' **
  When SEing a company to refund an Item, some SE'ers prefer to file a dispute through PayPal by using the **"SNAD"** (Significantly Not As Described) option. As Its name Implies, It's used to say that the description of the Item that was ordered, was different to the one that was received. This Is similar to the traditional ***wrong Item received method***. 
  Examples
  * Use SNAD for almost any Item you plan to SE
* SE the company first and If It fails, then use SNAD 
* I opted for PayPal's SNAD and my SE succeeded
  **PayPal 'INR'**
  As with the above example regarding a PayPal dispute, the only other reason you can submit a claim, Is for an **"INR"** **(Item Not Received)**. It's pretty self-explanatory, meaning the package that the carrier was supposed to deliver, was not received. This Is the same as the good old "DNA" method that SE'ers commonly use when social engineering online stores.

Examples 
  * What are the chances of the INR with Argos?
* You can SE any Item using the INR.
* The INR & SNAD are the only options for a dispute.
  **What Are 'Refunders?'**
  You may not come across this term too often In any given social engineering community, but nevertheless, you never know when you may require this type of service- particularly when you cannot do the job yourself. 'Refunders', also referred to as a 'Refunder' Is when SE'ers take advantage of an entity, such as a PayPal dispute/claim or a credit card chargeback, and specialize In reimbursing funds Into the accounts of those who utilize their services.
  Examples
  * HF doesn't have any good refunders, so look elsewhere.
* PM me, I can recommend you a good refunder.
* I know many refunders that use the SNAD method. **The Definition Of 'CSR'**
  I can confidently say, that this Is one of the least used terms In the world of social engineering. In fact, I've only stumbled upon It a handful of times In Its abbreviated form, namely **"CSR"** which stands for **"Customer Service Representative"**. Its meaning pretty much speaks for Itself- a rep who works for a particular company and handles the needs of Its customers, such as dealing with returns & replacements, processing orders & claims and so forth. It's almost always used as **"CSR".**
  Examples
  * The CSR said he'll get back to me In 3-5 days.
* I SEd the CSR easily and he gave me a refund.
* What's the name of the CSR you spoke with? **The Meaning Of 'PEB'**
  If you're familiar with the ***partial method***  or you've just read Its definition a few paragraphs above, then you can certainly relate to the **"PEB"** which Is short for **"Partial Empty Box"**. As a matter of fact, It's no different to the partial method, only worded In another context. At the time of writing, **"PEB"** Is not used often at all, but It's becoming somewhat popular with those who are new to the social engineering scene. I assume that SE'ers have put together **"EB"** (Empty box) and **"Partial"** to form **"PEB"**.
  Examples
  * I've decided to PEB the SSD with Amazon.
* How many Items are you planning to PEB?
* Using the PEB with those sunglasses will work.

 

**什么是“服务标签？”**

 

也称为“序列号”，**“服务标签”**主要与笔记本电脑相关，用于唯一标识产品，例如用于驱动程序、在线支持和保修目的。 ***社会工程师用它来做后者(保修)*** 当通过创建一个假的“POP”(购买证明)和一个投递地址/地址来销售戴尔、惠普等公司的退款或更换产品时。为此，服务标签显然必须仍在保修期内。

 

例题

 

我从一个卖家那里得到了服务标签，非常便宜。

我在易贝认识了一个人，他给了我服务标签。

我想戴尔服务标签在笔记本电脑下面。

**如果你刚刚在这个博客上第一次看到这个方法，那么我可以很自信地说，你从来没有在任何网络资源上读到过它——嗯，不是从它的标题上。 ***那是因为我是‘间接正法’***的创造者，任何人如果声称不是这样，就是抄袭了我的作品。与其他直接销售商品的方法不同，这种方法用于销售非常简单(并且保证有效)的商品，获得退款，然后购买您最初想要的商品。简而言之，你卖出一件商品，获得退款，然后购买另一件——因此**【间接】** SEd。**

 ****

**例题**

 ****

***如果笔记本电脑太难销售，使用间接销售方法。**

***我已经用间接销售方式把 AirPods 退了，买了 SSD。**

***间接销售法可以搭配任何你喜欢的物品。** 

## **DNA ' ing 的定义**

 **这在引用**“DNA 方法”**时是基于相同的原理使用的，但是在不同的上下文中。它指的是销售人员当前正在使用该方法做什么，或者计划以后使用该方法做什么。成员之间很少讨论**“DNA’ing”**，但尽管如此，它的用法还是值得注意的。你绝不会碰到没有缩写的单词，那是因为没有缩写，即使你试图扩展它，它也没有任何意义。

例句

*司机把包忘在我家门口了，所以我就 DNA'ing 了。

*你对亚马逊的笔记本电脑进行了怎样的 DNA 检测？

*为什么在可以使用缺失项方法的情况下DNA ' ingSSD？

**【LIT】的缩写**

这是一个你很少在留言板和网上聊天中遇到的术语，但不管它有多罕见，了解与 SEing 相关的一切都是必不可少的。因此，包裹将被标记为已送达，但** *****在运输途中丢失*** 。

例题

*可以用点燃的方法处理任何包吗？

*公司会看到是亮了并批准你的索赔。

*与 DNA 相似，但顺序相反。

**【次品法】定义**

顾名思义，**【次品法】**是在社会工程师购买一件物品时使用的方法然后，代表/代理将执行一些常规的故障诊断步骤，当他对产品缺陷感到满意时，他将发出退款或更换通知， ***，但仅当无法正常工作的产品被退回时*** 。用户可以通过使用 ***盒方法*** 轻松规避退货。

例题

*说明项不适合有毛病的项方法。

*只需使用故障项目方法说电池漏水。

*我用故障项目方法轻松地向销售代表要求退款。** **

## ‘TID’的含义

当您将您的商品寄回公司要求退款或更换时，或者您已经购买了某些商品并正由他们的承运商运送时，一个**“跟踪 ID”**(缩写为**“TID”**)用于跟踪运输途中的货物。它还用于确认包裹是否到达目的地。当使用投递站/地址时，它很方便，它允许用户准确地看到他们的包裹何时到达，因此他们可以在司机到达时领取包裹。

 

例题

 

*当包裹被扫描时， TID 出现在他们的系统上。

*垃圾 FTID 法是利用 TID 得到的创意。

*只要给贝宝看一下 TID ，你就能拿到退款。

 

**什么是 DNA 能？**

正如你很可能从它的标题中猜到的那样，这显然与 *DNA(未到达)方法*有关，用于表示一个物品、公司或承运人是否事实上与 DNA 方法本身兼容。它的缩写 ***DNA'able*** 在主要的社会工程板上很少使用，但是和每个 SEing 术语一样，熟悉它的含义和用法是至关重要的。因此，当你在旅途中阅读帖子的时候，你不会一无所知。

例子

*那台笔记本电脑很容易DNA’able。

*我不认为 DPD 是 DNA'able ，他们拍你房子的照片。

*如果亚马逊不要求 OTP，他们就可以 DNA 化。

## 【DNA It】定义

相对于***【DNA(未到达)方法*** 有如此多的缩写，以至于要跟踪批次可能有些困难对每一个人都有充分的了解是很重要的，包括**“DNA It”**，意思就是直接声称你没有从承运人那里收到包裹。

例题

*一定要用 DNA 它而不是用分部法。

*司机把包裹留在我家门口，所以我要 DNA 它。

*如果我 DNA 它，Argos 会开调查吗？

 ****

**当销售一件具有某种功能的产品时，如果你联系销售代表声称该产品无法使用，罗技& SteelSeries、 ***等公司会要求你销毁该产品，而不是将其退回进行退款/更换*** 。他们的要求是录制一段视频，演示(例如)切断电线、折断按键/按钮、在产品上钻孔等过程。很明显，您无意满足他们的要求，因此您会将**“损坏的视频方法”**付诸行动，发送他们无法观看的视频片段，从而指责他们没有能力相应地处理您的索赔。**

 ****

**例题**

 ****

***用破坏视频方法改变 URL 中的单个字符。**

***在任何视频分享网站上都可以使用破坏视频方法。**

***多次点击损坏的视频方法，直到销售代表批准索赔。**

 ****

****一个‘高级交换’****

 ****

**如果你已经阅读了本文中的**“AR”**(高级替换)主题，那么你会非常容易地联想到**“高级交换”**。这是由戴尔提供的，与 AR 相同，但措辞不同。简而言之，先行更换意味着公司**会“提前”**给你发送替换产品，当你收到它时，你应该退回你的有缺陷的部件。以你的身份，你不会做这种事的。为了避开他们的请求，你可以把他们装箱或者使用一个投递地址来接受替换，然后消失。**

 ****

**例题**

 ****

***如果你没有通过高级交换返回你的物品，你的账户将被扣款。**

*** 高级更换是戴尔独有的服务。**

***使用高级更换时，确保您的显示器在保修期内。**

 ****

****‘DOA’是什么意思？****

 ****

**在我有幸在这本百科全书中记录的所有术语和定义中，**“DOA”**，意思是**“到达时死亡”**是社会工程术语中使用最少的缩写。在写这篇文章的时候，它很少在活跃的销售社区中被提及，但尽管如此，每个用户都必须熟悉它的含义——它用来表示由承运商交付的物品没有功能，因此当它被接收时是**“到达时死亡”**。**

 ****

**例题**

 ****

***告诉销售代表显示器是 DOA 并获得高级更换。**

***物品为 DOA 时可以使用故障物品法。**

***不要说 AirPods 是 DOA ，用缺失物品法。**

## ****【WIR】的缩写****

**传统方法有许多缩写，如 PEB、DNA、LIT 和 EB——所有这些都被广泛应用于当今公司操纵和剥削的世界，然而对于**“WIR”**就不一样了，后者代表**“收到错误的项目”**。以我在一个非常活跃的社会工程委员会的经验，我只遇到了不到几条以缩写形式讨论该方法的消息，但尽管如此，知道它表示什么是很重要的——因为如果你在之前从未听说过它，你就不会知道它指的是什么/与什么有关。此外，谷歌搜索不会返回任何结果，它只是不索引在这种社会工程的能力。**

 ****

**例题**

 ****

***使用 WIR 方法时，确保物品是从同一家公司的假账户上购买的。**

**你认为卖 AirPods， WIR 和遗失物品法哪个更好？**

**任何有存货的公司都可以使用 WIR 方法。**

 ****

**虽然**【CC】**的意思很明显，但是如果你没有在社会工程术语中见过它的缩写，你可能会有点不知所措，这是理所当然的——它可以有很多不同的解释。作为一个自我感觉良好的人，我会说假设你拥有一张**【信用卡】**是安全的，这正是它的意思，因为一些论坛有关键词过滤功能来防止关于信用卡之类的讨论，会员们转而使用**【CC】**来确保他们的帖子能够被生成。**

**例题**

 ****

***联系您的 CC 提供商，对您的 SE 进行退款。**

**嘿，如果我不退回显示器，惠普会给我的 CC 开账单吗？**

**我还未成年，所以我不能用我的名字注册 CC ，但是我会让我爸爸用他的。**

 ****

 ****

****【厂商漏项法】****

 ****

**这是**遗失物品法**的变种，你声称在购买你的产品并打开盒子时(是的，它必须是**工厂包装在** **【盒子】**)里面什么也没有，这意味着只有盒子交付给你，没有你的物品。从本质上讲，是制造商忘记包装物品，因此只把盒子寄给了公司，而你只是碰巧买了它。这类错误发生的频率比你想象的要高得多，这就是为什么**“制造商遗漏项目方法”**如此有效。**

 ****

**例题**

 ****

***制造商漏项法的重量限制为 120 克。**

***使用制造商遗漏项目方法时，确保箱子完全被纸板覆盖。**

***仓库有没有厂家漏项法的闭路电视也没关系——他们看不到箱子里面的东西。**

****【漏项篡改法】****

**如果你熟悉传统的漏项篡改法，你就不会有与**【漏项篡改法】**相关的问题。你可能不会从它的**标题**中认出它，因为我是这个方法的作者，我也对它的制定和执行负责。好吧，就其目的而言，当你打开由承运人递送的包裹时，你会声称你的物品丢失了。如果该公司试图否认，因为他们的记录显示该项目是附在一起的，你会说**包装/盒子在你收到它的时候已经损坏了**。这给人的印象是**它被篡改了，**因此你的东西在到达你的地址之前就被偷了。因为它(显然)发生在运输途中，该公司无法证明其他情况。**

**例题**

***缺件篡改法适用于任何送包裹的公司。**

 ***任何人都可能在使用缺失项目篡改方法时窃取您的产品，甚至是司机。

*用缺失物品篡改法调查是没用的，因为他们无法核实包裹离开承运人的仓库后发生了什么。

 

 

**什么是‘CRN’**

当使用 **DNA** (未到达)方法时，通过声称您没有收到由承运人司机递送的包裹，该公司很有可能会展开**调查** -尝试并确定为什么它没有到达正确的地址。如果他们的记录显示司机将车留在你家门口无人看管，代表会认为车被偷了，因为这似乎是一起与盗窃有关的事件，你可能会被要求提交一份警方报告，并提供一份**“CRN”**，这是**“犯罪参考号”**的缩写。销售代表可以使用 CRN 来检查报告的有效性。

例子

*他们可能会交叉核对警方的报告，所以不要伪造 CRN 。

*别担心， CRN 只是用来引用报告。

*有时候警察给 CRN 需要一段时间，所以要有耐心。

**【MEB】代表什么？**

尽管**【MEB】**在各种形状&大小的社会工程社区中并不经常使用，但知道它代表什么以及与什么有关仍然很重要——也就是说，因为你将需要在你的销售活动中的某个时候解释它。简单来说，**是**【厂商空箱】**的缩写，与*厂商漏项方法*相同，上面讨论了几个话题，具体请参考那个(话题)。**

**例题**

***用 MEB 方法确定物品小于 120 克。**

 ***听说蓉城很难用上 MEB ，是真的吗？

*不要MEBCPU——这可以从盒子的外面看出来。

虽然涉及信用卡和银行设施，但用户通过*以新身份*建立另一个**假 PayPal 账户**，使用**与 **PayPal** 进行**，然后*在其主 PayPal 账户*(用假账户)上进行购物。因此，看起来好像是黑客做的(但这是社会工程师！)并将资金退还到卖家的主要 PayPal 账户中。****

****举例****

*****在做一笔 未授权交易时****

 *****当我撞上一笔未授权交易时，PayPal 能抓住我吗？

*做得贪婪，只做一两个未经授权的交易就此打住。

**In Conclusion:**
  Well, I have no doubt that you didn't expect this article to be so detailed, correct? I've spent countless hours documenting every abbreviation, term and the like relative to social engineering, thus you now have a complete SEing encyclopedia at your disposal. ***Sure, I've most likely missed a few bits and pieces here and there***, but after all, I'm only human! I shall periodically update this post as new or forgotten terms come to mind, so be sure to visit this on a regular basis for the latest additions.**********
