## **社会工程师总有一个权威人物。**

Generally speaking, when social engineering a company over the phone with the Intention to obtain a refund or replacement for an Item that (for example) you don't have to begin with, It's the company's representatives who're In charge of the conversation. 
  The company will have certain protocols and guidelines In place that the representatives must comply with during the claims process, therefore the conversation will be based on the rep's questions and concerns. As such, they'll have the upper hand with all decisions made. Basically, they call the shots, and the SE'er must abide to try and succeed. This Is certainly not good practice from a social engineer's standpoint.
  A good social engineer manipulates the representative by assuming an authoritative figure, thus takes control of all communications. He will use some degree of reverse psychology to get the representative to do the opposite- comply with **"his requests"**, rather than the other way around.
  For example, If the SE'er Is claiming a refund for a faulty Item, **"he will first tell the rep"** that he's been through all the troubleshooting steps before the rep has the chance to begin. He will also say that he's perfectly fine with either a refund or replacement, before the rep has the chance to state the opposite. Moreover, the social engineer will **"tell"** (not "ask") the rep to process the claim asap, In a polite yet firm manner.
  No doubt the representative will try to argue a number of points, but because the SE'er has already taken control of the conversation and keeps It that way throughout the entire SE, the rep Is on the back foot, hence Is operating In defense mode. 
  Taking **"control"** of the SE, not taking **"no"** for an answer, being **"adamant"** with the claims process and **"persevering"** from start to finish, will result In a successful outcome. This Is what defines an elite social engineer, and the reason why he can manipulate his target to his advantage- each and every time.
