## **向公司发送被破坏的视频链接。**

On the grounds that you're social engineering a company for an Item that you **"haven't purchased to begin with"** by claiming It's defective, where warranted, the first thing they'll do Is go through a few troubleshooting steps. During this process, ***obviously you'll say that the Item Is still not functional**. *
  As such, before they can Issue a refund or replacement, the representative will ask you to **"take a video of the nonfunctional Item"**- and to also Include a few Identifiable details, such as Its serial number and perhaps a handwritten note. This Is to verify that what you're saying Is true and correct.
  Given you don't have the Item, but rather obtained Its serial number from an Innocent buyer on the Internet, thus you're **"claiming a warranty refund"**, how are you supposed to take a video of something that doesn't exist? Well, there are a number of ways to circumvent this, one of which Is to **"send a corrupted video link to the company"**. Provided you execute your SE accordingly and **"persevere with the representative In question"**, this has a very high success rate. Let's have a look at what It Involves.
  **What The Company Will Request:**
  Generally speaking, the company requests you to ***take a video and then upload It to the most common platform on the net, namely YouTube***. Sometimes, they may ask to upload It to another platform, such as Dailymotion, but the corrupted video method still remains the same. Now It **"doesn't matter what video Is uploaded"**, and you'll see why In a few moments. You're then required to **"send them the URL/Link"** via (for example) email, whereby they'll check It and decide If a refund/replacement should be Issued. Of course, you're planning to SE them, so the video won't work. We'll checkout the SE now.
  **The SE In Action:**
  I keep mentioning **"Link"**, and with very good reason. What you do Is, ***upload any video you like to YouTube***, and then **"change a single character In the URL"**. This will render the video useless, however It will still **"show that It's hosted on YouTube as a video"**. This Is very Important- as the rep will be on the assumption that your video does In fact exist on YouTube!
  Due to the nonfunctional video, no doubt the representative will again ask for the video link, and you simply do the exact same- change one or two characters In the URL. At this point, **"assure the rep that It's working perfectly fine on your end"**, and you don't understand why they cannot view It. 
  This process will Inevitably be repeated several times. To make them believe It's an error on their end, this time, ***record the video with only 10 seconds of viewable footage*** that shows your back to the camera and (seemingly) getting the Item and other bits & pieces ready. Then ***be sure to blackout the rest of the video***, for around a minute or so. As a result, once again. they'll think that they're at fault. After so many failed attempts to view the video on their end, they'll eventually give In and approve your claim for a refund.
  **Why The SE Succeeded:**
  **There are a number of reasons as to why the SE succeeded as follows.**
  * You complied with every request without hesitation.
* Changing only one character In the URL still showed the video hosted on YouTube.
* You assured the rep that It was working fine on your end.
* You provided a footage as requested, but cleverly prematurely ended It.
* You made It seem as though they were at fault throughout the entire process.
  **In Conclusion:**
  This method has proven to work with many companies on a very large scale, but the key to Its success Is to ***persevere***, be ***adamant*** and ***take control*** of the claims process by reversing the situation and making It seem as though they're at fault. What you've just read here, also applies to any other method that takes a number of steps before a company decides to generate a refund/replacement, so manipulate this method according to your needs. Remember: **"You're In control!"**.
