## **声称没有收到包裹。**

In the social engineering world of **"company manipulation and exploitation"**, SE'ers go to great lengths to get what they're after, meaning refunds and/or replacements for Items that they've either already purchased, or by using (for example) the **"serial number method"** and claim the refund whilst It's still under warranty. In order to do this successfully, It's of the utmost Importance ***to use a method that's based on the nature of the Item***. For Instance, If you're planning to SE a "PS4" (Play Station 4) that weighs 2.5 Kg by using the **"missing Item method"**, due to Its weight, It will obviously fail. As such, you'd simply opt for another method- ***the wrong Item received *** or the ***sealed box *** method will suffice.
  ***Methods are the backbone and an Integral part of every SE***, ***and determine the effectiveness of your attack/execution against your target***. If you haven't chosen one that's compatible with your Item, your SE has failed before It had the chance to begin. But what If you're struggling to find a suitable method? Well, that's when the **"DNA"** **(Did Not Arrive)** comes Into action. If you're reading this as an advanced SE'er you'd know exactly what I'm referring to, but on the grounds that you've never come across It before, allow me to define It as follows.
  **What Is The DNA Method?**
  As you're aware, **"DNA"** Is an abbreviation of** "Did Not Arrive"** which (as Its name Implies), Is used by social engineers to say that ***the package they've been waiting to be delivered to their house (or a drop address) did not arrive***. That Is, they've purchased something from an online store such as Currys or ASOS, and the carrier failed to drop It off at their premises. Of course, the SE'er did received It but will SE the company by stating otherwise. The best thing about the DNA Is that It's **"carrier-based"**, hence considered a ***"universal method" that can be used with just about any Item you like***.
  Think about this from a logical standpoint. When ordering online, every package Is delivered by a given carrier Irrespective of what It contains, correct? Good, I'm glad you agree! Essentially, no matter what you've bought- be It a cell phone, a computer or a pair of trainers, It will be dispatched and sent to you. Clearly, you can now see why ***the DNA Is a carrier-based universal method***. Its flexibility Is certainly a huge benefit, namely when you're having difficulties applying other methods, however the DNA Is not all sunshine and rainbows- ***It has one major disadvantage that you must familiarize yourself with***, so let's check It out now.
  **The Disadvantage Of The DNA Method:**
  For the most part, there's no doubt that there will be some degree of difficulty when SEing, regardless of the method you decide on using. In terms of the DNA, It's more to the fact that ***It can lead to a lengthy claims process that can take (In some cases) weeks to finalize***- and all this Is due to the company **"opening an Investigation"**.
  What this means Is, because the DNA Is carrier-based and given you're claiming that you did not receive the package, ***the company will contact the carrier and cross-check the consignment details to try and establish precisely what went wrong***. If their findings are Inconclusive, they may ask you to file a **"police report"**, by stating that everything you've said Is true and correct to the best of your knowledge,
  ***All this Is part of company protocol and Is no cause for concern***, but a lot of SE'ers stress over the Investigation Itself, and particularly whether they should put pen to paper on the police report. They even tend to try and falsify the report, which Is not good practice and should never take place. ***I can assure you that you have nothing to fear, so If you're asked to sign It, go ahead and do so***.
  Depending on the nature of your SE, Inclusive of the Item's (high) value, you may experience a high volume of calls and emails back and forth for days (If not weeks) during an Investigation, but be patient- ***the company Is simply processing your claim and nothing more***. You'll find that the majority of Investigations, have a successful outcome In favor of the social engineer. Now that you have a very good understanding of how things operate, let's see when the DNA method should be used.
  **When To Use The DNA Method:**
  Although It can be used with **"almost"** anything you like, If there's another method that's well-suited to the Item you're planning to SE (particularly when Its success rate Is high), then used that Instead of the DNA. For example, ***AirPods are very light and barely register a weight during shipment, therefore the "missing Item method" Is predominantly used by SE'ers***. Furthermore, the **"box method"** Is also used when (seemingly) sending the Item back for a refund- as It does not require to substitute the weight of the AirPods with extra packing or dry Ice. Evidently, you can still use the DNA, but ***you should always select a proven method as your preferred choice***.
  Notice how I've quoted **"almost"** In the above paragraph? That's because **the DNA does have Its limitations, hence Is capped as to what you can and cannot SE.** For Instance, If you're looking to social engineer a huge 700 litre fridge that weighs 200 Kg, the carrier driver will not leave It at your doorstep and walk off without requesting a signature. And If you're not home to accept It, then the delivery will most likely be rescheduled for a later date. So how do you determine what's best with the DNA? Well, the equation Is pretty simple- ***nothing too large, and anything of reasonable size and weight, Inclusive of very small Items ***.
  Basically, use common sense and good judgment and don't opt for something like the fridge or a 85 Inch Smart LED TV! To give you an Idea of how It works ***and of crucial value, what you must do prior to executing It***, checkout the example below. Be sure to read each and every word- It will give you a very good Insight of what's Involved right from the get-go, thus help you to apply your very own DNA with Incredible ease. To make It easy to follow, I've written everything In a numbered list form.
  **The DNA In Action:**

1.  假设你要对亚马逊或约翰·刘易斯等在线零售商的最新款 IPhone 进行社交设计。
2.  你要做的第一件事是研究他们的条款，看看谁对运输途中的货物损失负责。确定这一点非常重要，因为如果不是公司，那么他们将免除自己的责任，而**“你将不得不承担费用”**，这对于 se 来说毫无意义。
3.  以公司有责任为由，那你就好走了。
4.  现在，你需要了解他们使用的承运商类型，即确定他们是要求在交货时签名，还是直接把它放在你的店门口。
5.  我们会考虑最糟糕的情况，你会被要求签收包裹。
6.  现在你已经掌握了所有的细节，SE 开始了。
7.  你已经下了订单，预计几天后就会到货，所以为了避免重新安排时间或把订单留给邻居的麻烦，你把自己安排在了家里。
8.  那天，有人敲门，司机把包裹交给你，并把他的小手持设备交给你签字。
9.  你签了**“看起来是你的签名”**，但这只是一个随机的名字。你已经确保这是**【清晰可辨】**。
10.  为了让它看起来真实而不引起怀疑，你已经确保你 ***没有“潦草地写一些与试图规避真实签名相一致的东西！”**。*
11.  因此，现在给人的印象是货物已经交付，并由&签收。
12.  你联系了公司**【次日】**说包裹没到，
13.  他们已经开始对运营商进行调查，以交叉核对细节。
14.  他们试图拒绝你的索赔，理由是它被送到了正确的地址。
15.  然而你告诉他们， **你没有亲自收到** ，司机一定把它送到了别处。
16.  你还告诉他们检查他们的记录，看看是否有人签收。
17.  公司核对后，读出签名上的名字。
18.  这不是你的名字！你也给了他们同样的建议。
19.  经过几次调查后，公司认为这是他们的交货错误，并给你退款。

 

就这么简单。以上显然是一般性的指导，与任何细节都无关，但如果你是整个 DNA 过程的新手， ***我建议你用它来帮助制定你自己的 SE*** ，通过挑选与你的环境相关的东西。
  **总之:**
  我可以自信地假设，作为一个初学者，你应该已经从整体上了解了大量与 DNA 方法相关的信息，如果你从一个高级的角度阅读了这篇文章，它们可能是一些你不知道的零碎信息。根据上面的例子，我想指出最终导致 SE 成功的关键因素。

1.  Study the terms of the company.
2.  Identify who is responsible for the loss of goods in transit.
3.  identifies the carrier type used by the company.
4.  There is no suspicion caused by scribbling things that do not match the real signature.
5.  Random signature with clear handwriting.
6.  I contacted the company the next day, but it was not at the time of delivery.
7.  Tell them that you don't have [collect bags in person] .
8.  The company confirms that the signature has nothing to do with your name.

所有这一切不仅在某种程度上极大地促进了 SE 的顺利运行，而且最重要的是，帮助它朝着正确的方向前进并最终取得对您有利的结果。
