## 不要过多考虑你的销售工程师的进步。T3】

There's a lot going on In the profound mind of the social engineer, and unless you're reading this as an SE'er yourself with years of experience In the art of exploiting the human firewall, It can be very difficult to fathom just how his mind operates. ***If he's committed to SEing on a daily basis, be It companies on a large scale to obtain refunds and/or replacements for Items or manipulating people to grab their personal Information, seldom Is there time for leisure activities***, In fact, watching a favorite TV show or relaxing on the couch listening to music, rarely (If ever) Is part of the equation- there's simply no Interest whatsoever.
  Advanced/dedicated SE'ers have a one-track mind, and that Is **"to consistently SE a given entity without fail, or to help those who require assistance In every way possible"** and If It means Isolating themselves from all forms of distraction, they will do that without any hesitation at all. This preserves their mindset, thereby allows them to generate their full attention to the task at hand. However, Irrespective of a social engineer's level of expertise, they can lose their perspective at the best of times- namely **"overthinking the progress of the SE" *by trying to predict events before they have a chance to happen***. This Is very bad practice and for the most part, works against the SE'er.
  You see, It's one thing thinking about your SE based on the details you have right In front of you, ***but quite another to create all types of fanciful predictions***. The keyword here Is: **"predictions"**, meaning It's Impossible to forecast the exactness of your attack, Inclusive of the responses that you'll receive. Sure, you should well and truly prepare yourself for the unexpected, ***but It must be on the grounds that It will "Probably (most likely) happen" and not "Possibly (may/not likely to) happen!"***. There's a big difference between the two and If you don't follow the correct path, your SE Is destined to fail. The best way to give you a clear understanding, Is by demonstrating a couple of examples, so let's begin with the first one as per below.
  **Example One- Using The 'Wrong Item Received' Method:**
  Let's say you're planning to SE an Item by using the **"wrong Item received method"**, hence you'll obviously claim that the company sent something completely different to what you've ordered. You've researched their terms and conditions, *"purchased a stock Item as the wrong Item"*, and prepared your method based on your findings- In readiness for Its execution. The only thing left, Is to call the company, speak with one of their representatives and social engineer him for a refund. Instead of doing this, **"you overthink your SE by creating all sorts of scenarios, events and conclusions that may never occur!"**. Here's a breakdown of what I'm referring to.  

*   重量被承运人注意到怎么办？
*   如果他们扫描物品并提出问题，会发生什么？
*   如果他们决定展开调查呢？
*   如果我被要求签署一份警方报告怎么办？
*   如果警察不同意给我报告怎么办？
*   如果我的帐户被锁定了怎么办？
*   如果我的索赔被拒绝了怎么办？

  现在想一分钟左右。 ***以上一切以“确切的方式”发生的几率有多大*** 。我可以很自信的说:**“绝对零**”。 不可能每一个人都来找你。 而且，一半的东西与方法本身无关。 实事求是地说(并且提供了你的方法&攻击矢不留任何机会)，这才是你内心深处应该有的东西。

*   如果他们决定展开调查呢？

就是这样！任何事情都可能发生在公司内部的内部调查中，所以我们完全有理由(有点)担心并为此做好准备。 ***其余的都很简单，因此甚至不应该被考虑——也就是说，因为它们在一次撞击中发生的几率几乎为零*** 。让我们检查另一个例子，这次使用**“DNA”**(未到达)方法。

**例二——使用 DNA 法:**

 T2】

众所周知，**“DNA”**方法适用于从在线零售商处订购商品，当包裹送达时，你声称没有收到。不管你、公司和承运人之间的情况如何， ***如果你有效地制定并执行了你的攻击，它就会成功*** 。你能做的最糟糕的事情，就是通过**“过度思考 SE”**来破坏整个过程，并得出你自己的结论 ***，而与*** 毫无关系。许多社会工程师提出了以下可能性。

*   When did you call the company and say you didn't receive it?
*   What if my fake signature is rejected?
*   What should I do if the carrier takes pictures of my home?
*   Will carriers get into trouble because of DNA?
*   What if the carrier comes to my house to ask questions?
*   What if the operator calls and the parents answer the phone?
*   The company will initiate an investigation & Do you want a police report?
*   What if they send an affidavit to sign?

和上面第一个例子一样， **【每一个事件发生的概率为零】**。 信不信由你，我在一些场合遇到过来自不同成员的这些问题，在来回发布了无数消息后，他们唯一需要处理的事情是以下事件。

*   When did you call the company and say you didn't receive it?
*   Will the company file an investigation & and ask the police to report the case?

其余的都只是浪费时间和精力，从一开始就应该完全忽略。如果你有某种证据来证明你认为可能会发生的事情，那就完全是另一回事了，但是盲目地想出一些不经大脑的事情，不是你应该做的事情。

**总之:**
  我想重申的是，研究和制定您的 SE 以准备执行，并为整个索赔过程中的意外情况做好准备，这当然是至关重要的， ***然而，这必须在现实的条件下完成。*** 如果你打算坐在那里，根据**“如果怎样”**做出各种各样的预测，那么你最好完全忘记社会工程。
***每一次 SE 都是走一步看一步，你决定采取的每一个回应和行动，都取决于公司回复的性质*** 。因此，你会发现你头脑中的大部分事情，永远不会与你的社会工程攻击的精确程度相匹配！
