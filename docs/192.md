## **要求向警方报案。**

Depending on the method used by the social engineer and/or the cost of the Item, the company can ask the account holder to obtain a **"Police Report"** to help with their Inquiry. Amongst other reasons, the police report Is often requested when the customer says that the carrier did not deliver the package to his home. That Is, using the "DNA" (Did Not Arrive) method.
  It's basically nothing more than a bit of paperwork, to say that everything the account holder has said Is true and correct to the best of his knowledge. In other words, It's simply part of company protocol to move forward with the claim. 
  When the report has been filed and the Investigation Is complete, the customer's claim Is then processed. Social engineers are well-Informed about this, and also know that the report Is not legally binding, therefore they have no hesitation In obtaining one from their local police station. In fact, the majority of claims Involving a police report, have a successful outcome.
  So from an SE'ers standpoint, If you're asked to file a report, simply comply and obtain one at your earliest convenience. Do remember, that It's predominantly used for administrative purposes and nothing more.
